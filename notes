Did in Rust: 1-14 and 16

In Python currently I have done: 1-5 and 7

Want to review 7 in the light of object references, lifetimes etc

Remaining ones to redo or not:

6. Manhattan distances and regions. Not particularly exciting.
8. Metadata and values. Easy and might be good for data structure practice.
9. Marble game. Only for completeness
10. Star alignment. Maybe redo?
11. Sums of cells. Maybe?
12. Cellular automata. Good exercise.
13. Mine cart. Do.
14. Recipes (circular order again). Not exciting.
16. Opcode detection. Do.
